# Party Animals Missions Tracker

## Credit and Inspiration
Let's give a big shoutout to the developer for the [paliatracker](https://www.paliatracker.com) web application for the inspiration for this project!

I love everything about that project, especially the interface and design which inspired me to use the same libraries:
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/), and
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

# _(auto-generated)_
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
